# Backup / restore runbook (#1329)

```bash
# operator-driven or ad hoc, against a running node:
tape backup --url http://localhost:7137 --dest file:///tmp/tape-backups \
  --token "$TAPE_BACKUP_TOKEN" --retention-secs 604800
```

`--dest` accepts `file://` (always supported), `s3://` (feature `backup`,
`service-backup/s3`), or `gs://` (feature `backup`, always linked —
`service-backup/gcs` is unconditional). `gs://` authenticates via
workload-identity ADC in-cluster (GKE-proven) and Vat's
`STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST` locally. The bearer token needs `admin` on `*`; omit
it entirely when the node runs `--auth off`. `--retention-secs` prunes older
backup objects at the destination after a successful put; omit to keep
everything. In-cluster, the operator's backup CronJob passes
`http://<name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:7137` as `--url`.

## Cold restore runbook (#2465, #2468)

`bootstrapSeedUri` is **bootstrap-if-empty**, not a live restore endpoint: on
every boot the server first checks whether its durable `TAPE_DATA_DIR`
already has raft state. An empty data directory seeds from the URI as
before; a non-empty one (including a routine pod restart onto its own
already-bootstrapped PVC) **skips the seed and boots from its existing
state** instead of refusing, so the field is safe to leave declared on the
CR (fixed in #2468 — it used to be one-shot: any restart while the field was
still set crash-looped on the non-empty-PVC refusal).

1. Set `spec.bootstrapSeedUri` on a **fresh** instance (empty PVCs — a new
   deployment, or one whose PVCs were explicitly wiped) to the backup object
   URI.
2. Wait for the CR to report Ready, then verify the expected data replayed
   (e.g. `curl $BASE/topics/<topic>/replay?from_offset=0`).
3. Nothing further is required — future pod replacements restart onto the
   same populated PVC, detect existing state, and skip the seed
   automatically (`decision="skipped_existing_state"` in the pod log).
4. Recommended hygiene, not a requirement: remove the field once the
   bootstrap has converged.
   ```bash
   kubectl patch tape/<name> --type=json \
     -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/bootstrapSeedUri"}]'
   ```
   This guards against a narrower follow-on hazard: if the PVC is ever
   deleted and reprovisioned (not a routine restart) while the field is
   still set, the replacement pod's data dir really is empty again and WILL
   re-seed from the (possibly now-stale) backup object. Removing the field
   after a successful bootstrap makes that recreate-then-restart sequence
   fail loudly (no seed configured) instead of silently reseeding old data.
