# Tape

## Brief

Tape is Axiom's self-hosted stand-in for Google Cloud Pub/Sub: a
Raft-replicated, durable topic service where publishers append messages to a
topic and any number of subscriptions each receive every message, over tape's
own HTTP/1.1 + h2c API described by `/openapi.json`.

Cloud Pub/Sub is the feature-contract peer. [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) is the
checklist: one row per Pub/Sub surface, stating whether tape supports it
today, supports it with a named limit, or has not built it yet.
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) names the outcome that closes each gap.

Today tape ships durable single-message publish, named pull subscriptions that
each advance one cumulative cursor, per-topic retention, Raft replication with
peer mTLS (one replication case currently red, see [STATUS](STATUS.md)), whole-journal backup and cold seed, a Kubernetes operator, and
generated TypeScript, Python, and Rust clients. Per-message acknowledgement,
competing subscribers, push delivery, seek and snapshots, ordering keys,
message filtering, and schema validation are ROADMAP outcomes, not shipped
behaviour.

**Boundaries.**

- [`relay`](../relay/README.md) is the single-queue work-queue broker
  (RabbitMQ/SQS-shaped): one job, one worker, lease, ack, delete. Use relay
  when exactly one worker should take each job; use tape when N independent
  subscriptions must each see every message.
- [`defer`](../defer/README.md) is the Cloud Tasks stand-in for scheduled
  HTTP dispatch. Tape's push delivery (a ROADMAP outcome) is tape's own
  outbound HTTPS, not a hand-off to defer.
- Tape does not speak the `pubsub.googleapis.com` wire protocol, does not
  serve gRPC, and does not offer streaming pull, exactly-once delivery, or
  export subscriptions. It publishes no performance claim against Kafka,
  JetStream, or any other broker; the only performance gate is tape against
  its own baseline.

## Primary workflow

1. Run one node. `--store` keeps the journal on disk; without it the node is
   in-memory. Auth is off by default, so the calls below need no token.

   ```bash
   cargo run -q -p tape --bin tape -- serve --bind 127.0.0.1:7137 --store /tmp/tape/journal.json
   ```

2. Create a subscription on a topic. Topics exist implicitly; the first
   append or subscription creates one.

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7137/topics/orders/subscriptions \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"billing"}'
   ```

3. Publish a message. `key` is optional, `payload` is any JSON value, and the
   response carries the durable offset.

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7137/topics/orders/append \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"key":"order-1","payload":{"total":42}}'
   ```

4. Pull from the subscription. The batch reports the `cursor` it read from,
   the `events`, and the advisory `next_offset`.

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7137/topics/orders/subscriptions/billing/pull \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"limit":10}'
   ```

5. Acknowledge by advancing the cursor to `next_offset`. Until this call, a
   repeated pull returns the same events.

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7137/topics/orders/subscriptions/billing/ack \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"offset":1}'
   ```

The same verbs exist offline against a journal file for local inspection:
`tape append`, `tape subscription create|list|show|pull|ack|delete`,
`tape replay`, and `tape checkpoint`, each taking `--store <path>`.

## Topics and subscriptions

A topic is an append-only, offset-numbered journal. A subscription is a named
cursor into one topic. That is the whole model today, and it maps onto Cloud
Pub/Sub as follows.

| Pub/Sub concept | Tape today | Gap owner in ROADMAP |
|---|---|---|
| Message | `{key?, payload, timestamp_ms?}` on publish; stored as `{topic, offset, timestamp_ms, key?, payload}` | `attributes-and-filters` adds an attribute map; `schema-validation` validates `payload` |
| Publish | `POST /topics/{topic}/append`, one message per request, acknowledged after the durable write | `resource-lifecycle-parity` adds batch publish |
| Subscription | `{topic, name}` plus one cumulative cursor | `subscription-ack-and-competing-subscribers` turns it into a configured resource with leases, retry policy, and dead-letter topic |
| Pull | `POST .../subscriptions/{name}/pull` returns events from the cursor; every caller sees the same window until an ack | The same outcome adds per-message ackIds, in-flight leases, and competing pullers |
| Ack | `POST .../subscriptions/{name}/ack` sets the cursor | The same outcome adds per-message ack, `modifyAckDeadline`, and nack |
| Push | Not built | `push-subscriptions` |
| Seek and snapshot | `GET /topics/{topic}/replay?from_offset=` and `?from_timestamp_ms=` read the journal directly | `seek-snapshot-and-retention` moves seek onto the subscription and adds snapshots |
| Retention | `PUT /topics/{topic}/retention` with `min_offset`, `max_age_seconds`, `protected_consumers` | The same outcome proves age-based expiry and narrows the public shape |
| Ordering keys | `key` is stored and returned; delivery does not order by it | `ordering-keys` |
| Filtering | Not built | `attributes-and-filters` |

Two tape-only surfaces predate the subscription model and remain public for
now: journal replay (`GET /topics/{topic}/replay`, `/replay/stream`) and
consumer checkpoints (`GET|PUT /topics/{topic}/consumers/{consumer}/checkpoint`).
Subscriptions are built on them. They leave the public API in the
`seek-snapshot-and-retention` outcome, not before, because they are the
readback oracle for the current acceptance scripts.

## Contract discovery

| Need | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| Route inventory | `tape spec --format routes`, or `GET /openapi.json` on a running node. The committed [`clients/openapi.json`](clients/openapi.json) is byte-equal to live generation; a gate refuses drift. |
| Request and response schemas | `tape spec --format json-schema`, or the `components` section of the OpenAPI document. |
| CLI surface | `tape --help`; `tape llm` prints the agent-facing topic index. |
| Support state per Pub/Sub surface | [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) |
| Future outcomes and non-goals | [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) |
| Typed clients | [`clients/README.md`](clients/README.md) |
| Serve flags, environment, ports, probes, runbooks | [`docs/deployment-handoff.md`](docs/deployment-handoff.md) |
| Kubernetes custom resource | `tape k8s crd render`; the operator and instance layers come from `tape k8s operator render` and `tape k8s instance render`. |
| Backup destinations | `tape backup --help` lists the accepted schemes: `file://`, `s3://` (feature `backup`), and `gs://`. |
