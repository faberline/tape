# Tape Competitor Feature Parity Test

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

`apps/tape/tests/competitor_feature_parity.rs` is the functional EC backing
for Tape's first competitor feature matrix. It validates replay-log features and
keeps RabbitMQ topic exchange scoped to topic routing/fanout semantics.

## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->
