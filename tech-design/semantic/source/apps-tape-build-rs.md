# Tape Build Stamp

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

`apps/tape/build.rs` delegates to `libs/build-stamp` with the `TAPE` prefix,
emitting `TAPE_GIT_SHA`, `TAPE_BUILT_AT`, and `TAPE_TARGET`.

## Logic
<!-- type: logic lang: mermaid -->

    stamp --> env["TAPE_GIT_SHA / TAPE_BUILT_AT / TAPE_TARGET"]
    env --> toolinfo["cli_std::ToolInfo diagnostics for upgrade/issue"]
```
