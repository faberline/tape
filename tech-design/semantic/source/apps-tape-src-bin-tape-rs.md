# Tape CLI Surface

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

`apps/tape/src/bin/tape.rs` is the first agent-facing Tape CLI. It wraps the
local `TapeJournal` file store and exposes standard ecosystem commands through
`cli-std`.

## Logic
<!-- type: logic lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid
---
id: tape-td-flow
---
flowchart TD
    cli["tape CLI"] --> append["append: load store -> append event -> save -> print next replay"]
    cli --> replay["replay: load store -> print events -> next: done"]
    cli --> checkpoint["checkpoint get|put: read or advance durable cursor"]
    cli --> spec["spec: print routes/openapi/schema"]
    cli --> std["llm/upgrade/issue: delegate to cli-std"]
```

## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid
---
id: tape-td-flow
---
flowchart TD
    test["cargo test -p tape --test cli_contract -- --nocapture"] --> help["help_ships_standard_and_replay_commands"]
    test --> roundtrip["append_replay_checkpoint_roundtrip"]
    help --> surface["standard and Tape-specific commands visible"]
    roundtrip --> workflow["local file-backed workflow passes"]
```
