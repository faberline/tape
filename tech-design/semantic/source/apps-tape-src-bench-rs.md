# Tape Benchmark Core

## Overview
<!-- type: overview lang: markdown -->

`apps/tape/src/bench.rs` defines the first competitive-performance evidence
surface. It measures local append, replay, and checkpoint operations and also
models named real-service replay wins such as the NATS JetStream local backlog
gate. Other replay-log peer wins stay unclaimed until their own real-service
peer runs are added.

## Logic
