    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Preserve YAML 1.1-ambiguous string defaults when serializing the generated Tape CRD so Kubernetes receives auth.default as a string rather than a boolean. generator gap: missing-generator:kubernetes-crd-yaml-scalar-quoting (#1590)."

    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Install the shared process-level rustls provider before CLI dispatch so the operator's kube TLS client cannot panic when multiple providers are linked, and resolve the single-node operator PVC's TAPE_DATA_DIR to journal.json while preserving explicit --store precedence and Raft-only HA durability. generator gaps: missing-generator:peer-tls-bootstrap, missing-generator:single-node-pvc-store-resolution (#1590)."

    action: create
    section: e2e-test

    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Replace the absent-live-Kind caveat with the bounded operator recovery gate and retain explicit non-claims for multi-shard and soak coverage. generator gap: missing-generator:kubernetes-capability-evidence (#1590)."
