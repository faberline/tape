  - id: "stateful-service-workload"
    role: primary
    gap: "stateful-service-workload-projection"
    claim: "stateful-service-workload-projection"
    coverage: partial
    rationale: "This TD adds the shared baseline projection and explicitly composes existing Tape evidence without duplicating runtime ownership."
summary: >
  WI #1554 adds the required stateful-service-workload baseline root to the
  Tape capability map. The root composes existing journal, raft, backup,
  security-boundary, and StatefulSet evidence without asserting that any
  unfinished domain capability is complete or adding runtime behavior.
