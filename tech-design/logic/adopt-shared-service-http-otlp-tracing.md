## Unit Test
<!-- type: unit-test lang: mermaid -->

```mermaid

id: tape-shared-otlp-contract-verification
requirements:
  feature_propagation:
    id: R2
    text: "Tape's otel feature enables shared service-http tracing and has no Tape-local trace pipeline."
    kind: regression
    risk: high
    verify: cargo test -p tape --features otel --test shared_otlp_tracing -- --exact
  shared_initializer:
    id: R1
