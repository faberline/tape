```mermaid

id: tape-subscription-resource-contract
entry: create
nodes:
  create:
    kind: start
    label: "tape subscription create TOPIC NAME accepts exactly one of --pull or --push ENDPOINT"
  validate:
    kind: decision
    label: "mode flags are valid, push endpoint is non-empty, and the topic/name resource does not already exist"
  invalid:
    kind: terminal
    label: "nonzero CLI result names the invalid mode or existing resource; the journal stays unchanged"
  persist:
    kind: process
    label: "persist Subscription in the existing file-backed TapeJournal; create has no side effect on checkpoints"
  pull_view:
    kind: process
    label: "a pull subscription exposes the current optional checkpoint at topic/name so existing checkpoint get/put remains the cursor API"
  push_view:
    kind: terminal

  resource_ops:
    kind: process
    label: "list/show/delete address subscriptions by topic/name; delete removes only resource metadata and does not delete the consumer checkpoint"

## Changes
<!-- type: changes lang: yaml -->

```yaml
changes:
  - path: apps/tape/src/lib.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Add the file-backed Subscription model, pull/push delivery enum, keyed CRUD on TapeJournal, duplicate/not-found errors, and a regression test proving pull resource lifecycle leaves the existing topic/name checkpoint untouched. Keep this within the existing journal ownership boundary; generator gap: missing-generator:logic:tape-subscription-resource (#1254)."
  - path: apps/tape/src/bin/tape.rs
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Add `tape subscription create|list|show|delete`. Create requires exactly one of `--pull` or `--push <endpoint>`; commands load/save the existing `--store` journal and emit JSON plus a runnable `next:` marker. generator gap: missing-generator:cli:tape-subscription-resource (#1254)."
  - path: apps/tape/src/spec.rs
    action: modify
    section: schema
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Declare the topic-scoped subscription collection and item routes in routes_json/OpenAPI, define Subscription and delivery configuration schemas, and update agent API wording. This is offline API inventory only: do not add server.rs h2c handlers or claim runtime delivery. generator gap: missing-generator:openapi:tape-subscription-resource (#1254)."
  - path: apps/tape/tests/cli_contract.rs
    action: modify
    section: unit-test
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Add CLI-level deterministic coverage for help, pull/push create/list/show/delete round-trip, invalid mode rejection, and routes/OpenAPI/schema inventory. Assert push is stored as metadata without exercising an HTTP delivery path. generator gap: missing-generator:test:tape-subscription-resource (#1254)."
  - path: apps/tape/README.md
    action: modify
    section: logic
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Document subscription resources as a Tape core capability with pull checkpoint compatibility and push contract-only scope; do not claim a push worker, retry/redelivery, live h2c subscription handler, or raft-backed subscription state."
  - path: apps/tape/tech-design/semantic/source/apps-tape-src-lib-rs.md
    action: modify
    section: source
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: "Refresh the source snapshot from apps/tape/src/lib.rs after the subscription journal model changes."
