summary: Competitive performance — local Tape replay regression gate plus a real NATS JetStream replay win; other replay-log broker wins stay unclaimed until their own calibration gates exist.

# EC: Competitive Performance

Tape's competitive-performance gate mirrors Lumen's split between a fast local
regression gate and explicit peer calibration. The default local gate runs
Tape's append/replay/checkpoint path and verifies that it does not regress
against conservative local budgets. The external win gate starts a real
`nats-server -js`, publishes a 20,000-event, 128-byte-payload backlog into
JetStream, replays the backlog, and requires Tape's zero-copy `replay_refs`
path to replay the same local backlog at least 1.5x faster. Kafka, Redpanda,
Pulsar, and RabbitMQ Streams remain unclaimed until their own real-service
calibration gates exist. RabbitMQ topic exchange is recorded as routing-only,
not a replay performance baseline.
